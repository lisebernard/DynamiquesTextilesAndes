  abstract = {Abstract   Fabric image retrieval is beneficial to many applications including clothing searching, online shopping and cloth modeling. Learning pairwise image similarity is of great importance to an image retrieval task. With the resurgence of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent works have achieved significant progresses via deep representation learning with metric embedding, which drives similar examples close to each other in a feature space, and dissimilar ones apart from each other. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding method termed focus ranking that can be easily unified into a CNN for jointly learning image representations and metrics in the context of fine-grained fabric image retrieval. Focus ranking aims to rank similar examples higher than all dissimilar ones by penalizing ranking disorders via the minimization of the overall cost attributed to similar samples being ranked below dissimilar ones. At the training stage, training samples are organized into focus ranking units for efficient optimization. We build a large-scale fabric image retrieval dataset (FIRD) with about 25,000 images of 4300 fabrics, and test the proposed model on the FIRD dataset. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed model over existing metric embedding models.},

  abstract = {This article presents a series of informal experiments in software and weaving, most of which were conducted as part of the Weaving Codes, Coding Weaves project. Different aspects of weaving, including plain weave, a four-shaft loom, tablet weaving and warp-weighted weaving are simulated, in order to gain greater understanding of the craft from the perspective of computer science. The production rules of L-Systems are employed to begin to explore the expansive possibilities offered even by our simple simulations. In order to test our models and gain deeper understanding, the languages we produce are interpreted both as computer simulations and by our human selves, through the weaving of textile by hand. Physical user interfaces are introduced, in order to help communicate the structures and thought processes of weaving. Finally, we share our approach to representing a weave from the point of view of a thread. Throughout, our aim is not to simulate a weave in its entirety, but to gain and share insights into its complexity, and begin see how the long history of weaving, as a fundamentally digital yet ancient craft, can inform the younger fields of computer science and engineering.

  abstract = {Weaving is presented in this paper with relation to the four key categories of computational thinking: decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithms.~The role of weaving for the development of theoretical concepts is underestimated, because we perceive weaving as a minor craft with little technological challenge and impact. Where technological progress is measured in terms of gaining time from dull and tedious repetitive tasks, weaving appears to be the archetype of such repetitive work and thus as the more technological the faster it goes. We address this framing of perception by presenting ancient weaving as the earliest binary and digital technology. The PENELOPE project (ERC CoGrant no. 682711) aims to develop a theory of weaving as part of a deep history and epistemology for digital technology. In explicating the mathematical and computing principles invoked in weaving, we furthermore explore weaving as a kind of education that has the potential to engage tacit knowledge that is necessary to make technical and aesthetic choices in coding. By this, we argue for an alternative history of digital art.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

Fabric structural parameters mainly include fabric density, weave pattern, color pattern, etc., which need to be pre-set before production and carefully checked during quality control. The analysis of these parameters is considered the most crucial step in the textile industry. The commonly used manual operations based on human eyes and experiences are time-consuming and labor-intensive. In contrast, computer-vision-based methods or other automatic methods hold the advantages of quick response, objective evaluation, and high stability. In this paper, the background and definition of the analysis of fabric structural parameters are first introduced. Secondly, it offers some automated recognition systems and their configurations. Then, it describes an up-to-date survey across the existing methods and performs a comparative study of their characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. Besides, some evaluation matrixes are provided to evaluate the performance of automatic recognition methods. Finally, the report makes conclusions and discusses future research directions. This review can benefit researchers in understanding and utilizing automated methods to recognize fabric structural parameters. Promisingly, it can also provide some novel ideas for other recognition problems in the textile industry like fabric defect detection, fabric appearance analysis, and fabric inverse modelling.},

The dataset contains wide kinds of fabrics and detailed fabric structure parameters. Then, a novel multi-task and multi-scale convolutional neural network (MTMSnet) is proposed to predict the location maps of yarns and floats. By adopting the multi-task structure, the MTMSnet can better learn the related features between yarns and floats. Finally, the weave pattern and basic weave repeat are recognized by combining the yarn and float location maps. Extensive experimental results on various kinds of fabrics indicate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy and quality in weave pattern recognition.},

  abstract = {The widespread of smart devices along with the exponential growth of virtual societies yield big digital image databases. These databases can be counter-productive if they are not coupled with efficient Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) tools. The last decade has witnessed the introduction of promising CBIR systems and promoted applications in various fields. In this article, a survey on state of the art content based image retrieval including empirical and theoretical work is proposed. This work also includes publications that cover research aspects relevant to CBIR area. Namely, unsupervised and supervised learning and fusion techniques along with low-level image visual descriptors have been reported. Moreover, challenges and applications that emerged to support CBIR research have been discussed in this work.},

  abstract = {In this paper we explore new ways to approach understanding of the mysterious Precolumbian quipus, using both visual and sonic interpretations. We base our investigation on the Harvard Quipu Archive, starting with graphical visualisation techniques that give us an overall view so we can compare textile structures and perform basic cryptanalysis. We use listening and sonification in order to filter and compare the different modes of data representation (knot type, colour, twist and material). This provides new ways to explore both currently understood and unknown patterns of meaning in quipus.

Basándose en los aprendizajes de SILKNOW, un proyecto europeo dedicado a la puesta en valor del patrimonio sedero mediante herramientas digitales, este texto aboga por una mayor implicación de los museos y las instituciones del patrimonio en la difusión del conocimiento abierto.},

  abstract = {A textile fabric consists of countless parallel vertical yarns (warps) and horizontal yarns (wefts). While common looms can weave repetitive patterns, Jacquard looms can weave the patterns without repetition restrictions. A pattern in which the warps and wefts cross on a grid is defined in a binary matrix. The binary matrix can define which warp and weft is on top at each grid point of the Jacquard fabric. The process can be regarded as encoding from pattern to textile. In this work, we propose a decoding method that generates a binary pattern from a textile fabric that has been already woven. We could not use a deep neural network to learn the process based solely on the training set of patterns and observed fabric images. The crossing points in the observed image were not completely located on the grid points, so it was difficult to take a direct correspondence between the fabric images and the pattern represented by the matrix in the framework of deep learning. Therefore, we propose a method that can apply the framework of deep learning via the intermediate representation of patterns and images. We show how to convert a pattern into an intermediate representation and how to reconvert the output into a pattern and confirm its effectiveness. In this experiment, we confirmed that 93\% of correct pattern was obtained by decoding the pattern from the actual fabric images and weaving them again.},

  abstract = {Cataloguing pattern and tiling designs using their geometrical  features is an old research topic, whose main goal  is the synthesis of new designs. But little effort have been  made to approach the inverse problem, this is the analysis  of a design using image processing techniques. In this paper  a set of structural descriptors for automatically classifying  designs of textile and tile fabric is proposed. Graphic  descriptors as Parallelogram Fundamental, Design Cluster,  Design Symmetry Axes etc.. are properly re-defined in a  new framework that, using the Theory of Symmetry Groups,  tries to describe the structure of a pattern design. We describe  the sequence of operations introduced for the analysis  and extraction of these structural descriptors and the  methodology used in each stage, devoting special attention  to the techniques used in the image segmentation, object extraction,  and clustering stages. Experimental results with  textile patrimony images and tile museum images are also included.},
